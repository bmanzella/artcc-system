## ARTCC Management System

This system was developed and built by Matt Bozwood-Davies.

The ARTCC Management System is offered and provided to all ARTCC's of the VATUSA division. The code is provided as is, and webmasters can develop the system to their own individual needs, however requests can be made for fixes or features.

 `https://github.com/mbozwood/artcc_system.git`
 
 `composer install`
 
 `php artisan migrate --seed`

 Follow the instructions and the system will be good to go.
